# HaDge
A wearable thing for Hackaday folks.

We're building a conference badge. No, we're not planning on organizing a Hackaday conference. It's for all the other conferences Hackaday goes to. If you have this badge, you're a member of an elite club, able to socialize in meatspace just as easily as you do on .io.
